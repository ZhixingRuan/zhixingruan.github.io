- Glacier movement is closely related to changes in climatic, hydrological, and geological factors. 
- Detecting glacier surface flow velocity with conventional ground surveys is challenging. 
- Remote sensing techniques, especially synthetic aperture radar (SAR), provide regular observations covering larger-scale glacier regions. 

- This paper illustrated the technique extracting glacier surface flow velocity in the West Kunlun Mountains using modified offset-tracking techniques based on ALOS/PALSAR images.
- The offset detection applied cross correlation in the Fourier domain and global offset elimination of thin plate smooth splines.
