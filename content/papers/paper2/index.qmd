- As a sensitive indicator of climate change, mountain glacier dynamics are of great concern.

- To derive the ice movement of the whole glacier surface with a high accuracy, an integrated approach combining differential interferometric SAR (D-InSAR), multi-aperture interferometry (MAI), and a
pixel-tracking (PT) method is proposed in this paper.
